### Happy new year!

It's been a long time since my last post, and I'm not convinced I'll ever actually finish writing the Smart Snek post (project no longer necessary, and it's all but been retired now), but a lot has changed since then. The world is almost unrecognisable now compared to a year ago, and I'll be honest, it's scary. That being said, I'm not gonna tell you that you have to be brave and welcome the new world with open arms. It's okay to not be okay. Take some time to yourself, do something new, learn a language, learn to code, or just do nothing. Find what works for you in this "new normal" and let it bring you joy. For me, that's been learning Electrical Engineering and Sound Design, which is what this blog is all about. If you're really struggling with what's going on, reach out to someone. A loved one, a friend, or a charity setup to help people during crises. There's always help. Peace, Erin
