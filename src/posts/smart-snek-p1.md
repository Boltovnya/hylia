### Preamble

So, it's been a while since I last posted. To give a quick update as to what I've done in the meantime - I've set up OpenShift 5 times at home, realised I didn't have enough memory to run a stable cluster, given up, and left things as they were post-DNS install. I've also looked at buying more memory, but that's gonna need to wait a while because 192GiB of ECC DDR3 is still £££. Anyways...
